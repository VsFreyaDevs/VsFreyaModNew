- BF_kit is actually into Mika_kit lmao
- Milky is a demon(?), cuz yes (evident by his "Shadow" form)
- we added baby edd/freya and inverted edd cuz idk we thought it'd be funny lol
- BF_kit is a fucking piece of shit lmao, everyone hates him (except Mika and Pallu, they TOLERATE him)
- K. Animate's full name is "Killer Adobe Animate Creative Cloud".
- Milky's last name is "Lactose".
- Milky likes candy. (lol)
- The backstory is: apparently GF got angry after BF dumped her, so GF turned him into a kit and teleported him into the white void. The same white void that is, the Kitsune multiverse.
- BF_kit is 14 y/o.
- Pico_kit is, unlike BF_kit, a Mika hater and the only reason they’re battling in the Pico mixes is just for the sillies (only major difference is milky and kanimate don’t get mad near the end)
