### About Vs. Freya

A kitsune version of BF was walking in the kit world when he stumbles upon [FreyaFennec_foxes](https://www.youtube.com/@Freyafennec_foxes1.0) and her crew. Turns out this version of BF is actually a Freya hater and simps for [Mika_kit](https://www.youtube.com/@Mika_Kit162). He rap battles them under one condition: if he wins, he kills her.

## Kitsune Engine

Kitsune Engine is a fork of [Friday Night Funkin' (v0.5.x+)](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin) made to fix some problems the base game had while keeping the casual aspect of said game.

Kitsune Engine is an *engine* that's basically like those old engines from 2021-2022, only refactoring some of FNF's code and serving as an option for people who want more settings and customizability while keeping up with the latest base FNF updates.

> [!NOTE]
> Kitsune Engine has not been finished just yet! Though yes, you can port your V-Slice mods over, you may have to just make some changes to make your mod compatible to KSE.

# Friday Night Funkin'

Friday Night Funkin' is a rhythm game. Built using HaxeFlixel, originally for Ludum Dare 47: "Stuck In a Loop".

This game was made with love to Newgrounds and its community. Extra love to Tom Fulp.
