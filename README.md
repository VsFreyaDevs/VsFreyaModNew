### About Vs. Freya

A kitsune version of BF was walking in the kit world when he stumbles upon [FreyaFennec_foxes](https://www.youtube.com/@Freyafennec_foxes1.0) and her crew. Turns out this version of BF is actually a Freya hater and simps for [Mika_kit](https://www.youtube.com/@Mika_Kit162). He rap battles them under one condition: if he wins, he kills her.

## About Kitsune Engine

Kitsune Engine is a fork of [Friday Night Funkin' (v0.5.x+)](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin) made to fix some problems the base game had while keeping the casual aspect of said game.

Kitsune Engine is an *engine* that's basically like those old engines from 2021-2022, only refactoring some of FNF's code and serving as an option for people who want more settings and customizability while keeping up with the latest base FNF updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------

> [!NOTE]
> ***Kitsune Engine has not been finished just yet!*** While yes, you*can* port your V-Slice/Base Game mods over, you may however have to just make some changes to make your mod compatible to KSE.

-------------------------------------------------------------

* [Download builds for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android here!](https://github.com/VsFreyaDevs/VsFreyaModNew/actions)

* [ ] Move away from GitHub to git.gay
* [ ] Complete the mod!!!
* [ ] Fix minor annoyances/bugs
